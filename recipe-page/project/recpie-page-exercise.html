                   To make it into a meal, cook up bite-sized 
                   pieces of chicken and simmer them in the 
                   sauce until tender. Serve over fluffy 
                   basmati rice or scoop it up with warm 
                   naan. You can also toss in roasted 
                   veggies like cauliflower, chickpeas, or
                    paneer for a plant-based twist.
