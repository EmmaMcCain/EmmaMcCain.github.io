    <b> crown shyness</b> <i>(also canopy disengagment,
        <sup>[1] </sup> caanopy shyness, <sup> [2]</sup>
        or inter-crown spacing <sup>[3]</sup>) is a 
        phenomeon observed in some tree species, in which
        the crowns are  of fully stocked trees do not touch
        each other, forming a canopy with chanel-like gaps. 
        <sup>[4][5]</sup> The phenomeon is the most
        prevalent aong trees of the same species, but also
        occurs between trees of different speices.<sup>[6]
            [7]</sup> There exist hypothese as to why
        crown shyness is an adapative behavior, and
        research suggets that it might inhibit spread
        of leaf-eating insect larvae. <sup>[8]</sup>

<p>The exact physiological basic of crown shyness
    is not certain. <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomeon has
    been discussed in scientfic literature since the
    1920s. <sup>[9]</sup> The varitey of hypothese
    and experimental results might suggest that there
    are multiple mechanisms across different speices,
    an example of convergent evolution <sup> [

    Some hypothese contend that the interdigitation
    of canopy branches leads to "reciprcoal purning"
    of adjacent tree. Trees in windy areas suffer
    physical damage as they collide with each other
    during winds. As a result of abrasions and 
    colllisions, there is an induced crown shyness 
    response. Studies suggest that lateral branch
    growth is largely uninfluenced by the neighbours
    until distrubed by mechanical abrasion. <sup>[10]
</sup>If the crowns are artifically prevented from 
colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the gaps.
<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instance of crown shyness
 between branches of the same organism. Proponets of
 this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in
 conditions conducive to this pruning, including 
 windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early
 succession forests where branches are flexible and
 limited in lateral movement. <sup>[6][12]</sup> By
 this explanation, variable flexibility in lateral
 branches has a large bearing on degree of crown
 shyness.
